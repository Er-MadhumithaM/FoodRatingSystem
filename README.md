# Food Rating System

The Food Rating System is an innovative website created to facilitate the evaluation of food served in the companyâ€™s canteen. This platform aims to gather feedback from employees regarding their dining experience, helping to improve the quality of food and services provided.

The website comprises three primary web pages:

1. **foodRatingSystem.html**: This page is specifically designed for employees to submit their ratings about the various food items offered in the canteen. Employees can rate their meals on different criteria allowing the management to gain insights into employee satisfaction and preferences. 

2. **login.html**: This page is exclusively for canteen managers. It requires secure login credentials to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the management features. Upon successful login, managers are redirected to the next page "menuManagement.html".

3. **menuManagement.html**: This webpage serves as the control centre for canteen managers, allowing them to update the daily menu. Managers can add new items, change existing ones, or remove dishes that are no longer popular, ensuring that the menu remains fresh and appealing to employees.

This project was developed during my internship at Hirotec India Pvt. Ltd. in Coimbatore, where I gained valuable experience in web development and user experience design. The system not only enhances communication between employees and management but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement within the canteen services.
